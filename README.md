## ðŸ“š Business Problem
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the retail and wholesale industry.

dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:

* Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing adjustments.
* Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
* Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
* Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
* Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and high-performing vendors.
